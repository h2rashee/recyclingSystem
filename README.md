# Computer Science Program Dossier

## What is this?
This codebase is the program dossier for an [IBDP](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/sciences/computer-science/) CS HL candidate.

## Who is the use case?
The EIS-J Ecology club (environmental care and awareness interest group) runs a recycling program to promote reusability. All associated functions for the club
are managed by this software (rough version of vertical SaaS).

## Installation

```
make build
```

## Running it

```
make run
```

The default password for the program is `waterfall` which is stored [here](SystemSecurity.dat)

## Caveats
 - This software was written in 2008 by a naive developer
 - This was initially designed on a Windows machine on Java 6
 - You may see updates here over the course of time improving this repository to a more seasoned developer's maintainable standards
